#Bot
We have our own personal bot which hangs with us in our chat.

#Add more features
To add more features, first check if someone has already made them. We use github's hubot, which has an excellent collection of scripts for various purposes. You can get scripts from <http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com/>, and add them to this repository. You'd need to edit the `hubot-scripts.json` file for the script to be activated though.
